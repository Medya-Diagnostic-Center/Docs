"Every business is a software business", as Watts S. Humphrey, the father of quality in software and CMMI, said two decades ago.   

Operating in the digital age, businesses are increasingly reliant on technology to deliver their products and services. 

By applying fundamental principles and the culture of software engineering, we can build a robust and scalable technology ecosystem that can support the business in its digital transformation journey.

The following sections will provide an overview of the technology ecosystem at MDC, including the architecture, design principles, and best practices.

## Documentation and Knowledge Management
The documentation and knowledge management system is a critical component of the technology ecosystem. It provides a central repository for all technical documentation, design documents, architecture diagrams, and best practices.

The document you're reading now is an example of the documentation and knowledge management system.

## Cloud Native Microservices Architecture
Many operations can be streamlined and automated by building small and atomic services that are integrated with the existing systems of MDC.   

Examples of such services may include but are not limited to the following:

!!! note "Example"
	 **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to patients and doctors automatically when call center agents update the status of a patient's appointment/tests.


## DevOps and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
