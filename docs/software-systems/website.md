The public website is an informational website that provides visitors with information about MDC.

Following MDC's tech ecosystem guidelines, the website is built using the simplest technology stack and maintained by MDC's sophisticated development team.

## Technology Stack

The website will be built using a static website generator like **Hugo Static Site Generator** or **MkDocs**. The website is hosted on GitHub pages and utilizes **cloudflare** for DNS and CDN.

## Maintenance and Content Management
Since there are very few updates to the website, the content is managed using markdown files by the development team.
