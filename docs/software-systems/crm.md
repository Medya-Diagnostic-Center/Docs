The Customer Support Department is responsible for providing support to patients, doctors, and other stakeholders.

## Centralized CRM System
Having a CRM system will help the Customer Support Department manage customer interactions, track customer issues, and provide a better customer experience. This approach is more streamlined and efficient than using spreadsheets or other manual methods to track customer interactions.

## Communication Channel Integration
A CRM system that's integrated with various communication channels such as email, VoIP, WhatsApp, and Viber will allow the Customer Support Department to communicate with customers through their preferred channels in the same system.
