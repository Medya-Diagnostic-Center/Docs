The Customer Support Department is responsible for providing support to patients, doctors, and other stakeholders. 

## Centralized CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
Having a CRM system in place will help the Customer Support Department to manage customer interactions, track customer issues, and provide a better customer experience.

This is more streamlined and efficient than using spreadsheets or other manual methods to track customer interactions.

## Centralized Calendar View
A centralized calendar view will help the Customer Support Department to manage appointments, follow-ups, and other important dates.

## Communication Channel Integration
A CRM system that's integrated with various communication channels such as email, VoIP, WhatsApp, and Viber will allow the Customer Support Department to communicate with customers through their preferred channels in the same system.
